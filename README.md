# Magic-Engine
This is a simple 3D engine capable of rendering basic three-dimensional shapes on the screen. It uses fundamental 3D graphics principles such as projection, rotation, and translation to display objects in a virtual space. The engine allows users to create and manipulate 3D models in real-time, providing a basic framework for building interactive 3D applications or games. While it does not yet support advanced features like lighting, shadows, or physics, it lays the groundwork for a fullyfunctional 3D rendering system. Ideal for learning and experimentation, this engine helps users understand how 3D graphics work under the hood Of course, all these features have not been implemented yet and are the vision of this project :).
